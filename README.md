# Integrify Design Bootcamp

We are two junior web developers in training at Integrify (Helsinki, Finland); André is also a professional designer, and Xurxe has dabbled in all kinds of visual arts. Our teacher asked us to create and implement a design bootcamp for our classmates. The bootcamp took place on June 26th-28th 2019.
