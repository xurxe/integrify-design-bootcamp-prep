# Integrify Design Bootcamp

We are two junior web developers in training at Integrify (Helsinki, Finland); André is also a professional designer, and Xurxe has dabbled in all kinds of visual arts. Our teacher asked us to create and implement a design bootcamp for our classmates.

I developed this prep version of the project so I could rehearse my teaching for the actual bootcamp, which took place on June 26th-28th 2019. The version developed during the bootcamp can be found in [this other GitHub repository](https://github.com/xurxe/integrify-design-bootcamp).

Later, in August, a team of students from Integrify took over the project in order to finish for the client, Think Tank United.
